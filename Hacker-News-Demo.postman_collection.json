I am not allowed to leave the cabbage and lion alone together, and I am not allowed to leave the lion and goat alone together.  How can I safely get all three across?<p>In my test, GPT-4 charged ahead with the standard solution of taking the goat first.  Even after I pointed this mistake out, it repeated exactly the same proposed plan. It&#x27;s not clear to me if the lesson here is that GPT&#x27;s reasoning capabilities are being masked by an incorrect prior (having memorized the standard version of this puzzle) or if the lesson is that GPT&#x27;S reasoning capabilities are always a bit of smoke and mirrors that passes off memorization for logic.\",\n            \"by\": \"Imnimo\",\n            \"totalChildren\": 38\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"After watching the demos I&#x27;m convinced that the new context length will have the biggest impact.

A doctor can put an entire patient&#x27;s medical history in the prompt, a lawyer an entire case history, etc.<p>As a professional...why not do this? There&#x27;s a non-zero chance that it&#x27;ll find something fairly basic that you missed and the cost is several cents. Even if it just phrases something obvious in a way that makes you think, it&#x27;s well worth the effort for a multimillion dollar client.<p>If they further increase the context window, this thing becomes a Second Opinion machine. For pretty much any high level job. If you can put in ALL of the information relevant to a problem and it can algorithmically do <i>reasoning</i>, it&#x27;s essentially a consultant that works for pennies per hour. And some tasks that professionals do could be replaced altogether. Out of all the use cases for LLMs that I&#x27;ve seen so far, this seems to me to have the biggest potential impact on daily life.<p>edit (addition): What % of people can hold 25,000 words worth of information in their heads, while effectively reasoning with and manipulating it?
